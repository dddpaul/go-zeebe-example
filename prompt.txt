Write a program for running Camunda Zeebe process from REST endpoint.

Properties of the process:
- it example name CarInsuranceProcess
- have a several service tasks Task1, Task2 then message catch event WAIT_FOR_SIGNAL then service Task3
- all job workers implementing tasks should return string "Yes"
- There is no need to draw this process, just use it's name and implement workers

The whole program must:
1. Have 3 REST endpoints for:
- sync process instance start
- async process instance start
- callback
2. Sync endpoint must start process instance inside Zeebe, wait for callback, and return answer from completed process instance. Timeout for waiting callback is 10 seconds.
3. Async endpoint must start process instance inside Zeebe and return process instance ID.
4. Callback endpoint takes a process instance id and some message as input parameters and pass this message to WAIT_FOR_SIGNAL step in running process instance with corresponding process instance id.
